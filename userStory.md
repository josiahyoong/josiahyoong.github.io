"As a busy commuter who relies on taxis to get around the city, I often struggle to find a taxi quickly, especially during rush hour. With the TaxiFinder app, I can easily locate nearby taxis on a visual map and filter them by proximity to my location. I appreciate that the app refreshes the taxi locations every 10 seconds, ensuring that I have the most up-to-date information. Recently, I used the app to find a taxi near my office. I simply selected the 'User Location' button, entered my postal code, and within seconds, I could see the taxis in my area displayed on the map. The 0.2km radius filter was perfect for showing me only the taxis that were within walking distance. Thanks to the TaxiFinder app, I was able to quickly and easily find a taxi and get to my destination on time."
