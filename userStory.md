The Taxi Location app easily locate nearby available taxis on a visual map and filter them by proximity to my location. The app refreshes the taxi locations every 10 seconds to provide the most up-to-date information. From home or from work, I simply select the 'My Location' button and I could see the available taxis within my area. The 0.2km radius filters to show only the taxis that were within walking distance and allow me to see which direction can I go toward the taxi. Postal Code is an alternative search option when there is an error with 'My Location' search. 

On weekends, it helps me to plan my commuting options. I can monitor the taxi availability one hour before leaving the house and if the availability is low, I can consider other public transport options.
